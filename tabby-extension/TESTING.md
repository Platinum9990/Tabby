## üî¨ Comprehensive Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tab Management Intelligence
**Goal**: Test smart tab handling without AI dependencies

1. **Setup**: Open 10-15 tabs with diverse content:
   - Gmail or email site
   - GitHub or development site
   - YouTube or entertainment
   - News website
   - Shopping site (Amazon, etc.)
   - Social media

2. **Test Tab Search**:
   - Search for "email" - should find email tabs
   - Search for "github" - should find development tabs
   - Search for "video" - should find YouTube
   - Try partial matches and see smart results

3. **Test Tab Organization**:
   - Click "Organize Tabs" button
   - Should see logical groups: Email, Development, Entertainment, etc.
   - Groups should contain appropriate tab IDs

4. **Test Tab Recovery**:
   - Close a few tabs
   - Type "reopen last tab" in chat
   - Should reopen recently closed tabs

**Expected**: Smart categorization and search without needing AI APIs

### Scenario 2: Chat Interface Intelligence
**Goal**: Test conversational AI features and fallbacks

1. **Basic Chat Tests**:
   ```
   Type: "hello"
   Expected: Friendly greeting with feature overview
   
   Type: "help"
   Expected: List of available commands and features
   
   Type: "what can you do"
   Expected: Comprehensive feature explanation
   ```

2. **Command Tests**:
   ```
   Type: "organize my tabs"
   Expected: Tab organization with group suggestions
   
   Type: "find tab about youtube"
   Expected: Search results for YouTube-related tabs
   
   Type: "ai status"
   Expected: Current AI API availability report
   ```

3. **Context Tests**:
   - Navigate to a news article
   - Type "summarize this page"
   - Should attempt summarization or explain unavailable

**Expected**: Intelligent responses even without AI APIs

### Scenario 3: AI Feature Testing (Chrome Canary/Dev)
**Goal**: Test when Chrome's AI APIs are available

1. **Setup AI APIs** (Optional - only for full AI testing):
   - Use Chrome Canary or Chrome Dev
   - Go to `chrome://flags/`
   - Enable AI flags:
     - Prompt API for Gemini Nano
     - Summarization API for Gemini Nano
     - Writer API for Gemini Nano
     - Rewriter API for Gemini Nano
     - Translation API for Gemini Nano
   - Restart Chrome

2. **Test AI Status**:
   - Open `test-ai.html` in browser
   - Should show API availability
   - Green checkmarks = APIs working
   - Red X = APIs not available

3. **Test AI Features** (if APIs available):
   ```
   Chat: "ai status" ‚Üí Should show which APIs work
   Navigate to article ‚Üí Click "Summarize" ‚Üí Should get AI summary
   Chat: "what tabs do I have?" ‚Üí Should get AI-powered analysis
   ```

**Expected**: Enhanced AI features when APIs available, graceful fallback when not

### Scenario 4: Interface & Usability
**Goal**: Test user experience and interface design

1. **Theme Testing**:
   - Click theme toggle (sun/moon icon)
   - Should smoothly switch dark ‚Üî light themes
   - All elements should be readable in both themes

2. **Collapsible Sections**:
   - Click section headers to collapse/expand
   - Tabs section and Chat section should independently collapse
   - States should persist after closing/reopening popup

3. **Voice Input** (if supported):
   - Click microphone icon
   - Speak a command like "hello"
   - Should convert speech to text and process

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Try resizing popup window
   - Interface should adapt gracefully
   - No horizontal scrolling or cut-off elements

**Expected**: Polished, responsive interface with smooth interactions

### Scenario 5: Performance & Edge Cases
**Goal**: Test robustness and performance

1. **Heavy Tab Load**:
   - Open 50+ tabs (use Ctrl+click on links)
   - Extension should still respond quickly
   - Tab search should handle large sets efficiently

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with no tabs open
   - Test with duplicate tab titles
   - Test with very long tab titles
   - Test with tabs that fail to load

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Try invalid commands in chat
   - Test when APIs are unavailable
   - Should show helpful error messages, not crashes

**Expected**: Stable performance even under stress
