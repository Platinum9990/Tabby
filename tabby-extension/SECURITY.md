### üõ°Ô∏è Extension Security

TabSense AI is designed with security in mind:

**Local Processing Only**:
- No external API calls or data transmission
- All AI processing happens locally via Chrome's built-in APIs
- No user data leaves the browser

**Minimal Permissions**:
- Only requests necessary Chrome extension permissions
- No access to sensitive data outside of tabs
- No network requests to external servers

**Data Privacy**:
- Chat history stored locally only
- Tab metadata kept in browser storage
- No analytics or tracking

### üîç Common Security Best Practices

**For Users**:
- Only install from trusted sources
- Review extension permissions before installing
- Keep Chrome updated for latest security patches
- Report suspicious behavior immediately

**For Developers**:
- Follow Chrome extension security guidelines
- Validate all inputs and handle errors gracefully

- Regular security audits of dependencies

### üö® Known Security Considerations

**Chrome AI APIs**:
- Experimental APIs may have unknown security implications

- `storage`: For local settings and chat history
- `scripting`: For content extraction (when available)
- `alarms`: For idle tab detection
- `notifications`: For user notifications
